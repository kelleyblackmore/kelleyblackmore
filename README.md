## About Me
I'm a problem solver, systems thinker, and engineer passionate about building scalable solutions—whether in cloud platforms, DevSecOps environments, or emerging AI-driven workflows. I enjoy designing strong architectural foundations, automating complex processes, and exploring innovative engineering strategies. I’m hands-on with infrastructure, code, and security, and I’m motivated by impactful, real-world problem solving.

## What I Build
- Automated cloud and on-prem infrastructure for secure, air-gapped, or regulated environments  
- End-to-end CI/CD pipelines integrating compliance, testing, artifact management, and security  
- Infrastructure templates and internal developer platforms using Go, Python, Terraform, and Ansible  
- Tools for secret rotation, system discovery, and infrastructure provisioning  
- Prototypes for autonomous agents, local LLM tooling, and DevOps-focused AI assistants

## Current Work and Research
- Building out a platform engineering foundation for regulated environments  
- Refining Go-based CLI tools for DevSecOps, automation, and secrets management  
- Exploring local agent orchestration, secure AI workflows, and Mission Control Platform concepts  
- Experimenting with custom 3D-printed tools, enclosures, and hardware integrations

## How I Work
I’m a builder, architect, and collaborator—I value clean code, repeatable processes, strong documentation, and well-designed systems. I enjoy mentoring, designing platform strategies, and translating complex requirements into practical engineering solutions.

## Let's Connect
I'm always open to collaboration, knowledge sharing, and exploring engineering problems that push boundaries. Feel free to explore my repositories, contribute, or start a discussion.
